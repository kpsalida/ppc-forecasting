# Optimizing Next-Day Energy Price Predictions


In collaboration with Big Blue Data Academy and PPC, worked on a short-term data science consulting project for Optimizing Next-Day Energy Price Predictions. The project involved deploying AI models using regression and time series analysis to forecast next-day energy prices. We utilized predictive data from three independent energy price providers, alongside historical price data, to enhance accuracy. This solution will support the PCC Short-Term Market Analysis Unit in improving the precision of their 24-hour energy price predictions.In collaboration with Big Blue Data Academy and PPC, worked on a short-term data science consulting project for Optimizing Next-Day Energy Price Predictions.
